/**
 * The camera mode's gesture vocabulary, as hand shapes and as a per-ability
 * guide.
 *
 * `HandInput` reads a handful of poses — an open palm, a fist, a point — and
 * what each one *does* depends on what is in the slot: a fist casts a line
 * ability along the arrow, drops a far cast's circle where it is, deploys a
 * summon, and holds fire once that summon is out. So the guide is built per
 * ability rather than written once, and `CameraPanel` rebuilds it whenever
 * the slot changes. The hands are drawn inline like the ability sigils, so
 * they inherit `currentColor` and can light up in the tracker's green when
 * the pose they show is the one being read.
 *
 * The hands are silhouettes with the seams carved out. A one-colour hand
 * loses everything inside its outline — the thumb lying across a fist, the
 * fingers curled under a point — and without those it is a blob with bumps.
 * So each hand carries a mask that cuts thin transparent lines where the
 * fingers meet, and the panel behind shows through them. The cuts are
 * transparency rather than a painted colour so the same hand sits on the
 * plain tile and on the lit one without a halo.
