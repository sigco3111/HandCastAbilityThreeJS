/**
 * settings.js — the single source of truth for every tweakable value in the sandbox.
 *
 * Nothing in the renderer owns state that lives here: shaders, particle systems,
 * lights and post processing all *read* these objects every frame. That is what
 * makes the real-time editor work without rebuilding anything — mutating a field
 * is immediately visible on screen, including on a prison that is already
 * standing, and including while the clock is paused (`P`), which is when the
 * shapes are actually worth tuning.
 *
 * The one rule that keeps that promise: a system may only ever *sample* these
 * values. It must never copy one into a record at spawn time and read it back
 * later — see `CorruptedShardAbility`, whose cast captures nothing but a seed
 * and a handful of timestamps, and resolves every metre, radian and second
 * against this file each frame.
 *
 * Conventions
 *  - Colours are stored as `#rrggbb` strings so lil-gui can bind them directly.
 *    Use `utils/color.js#getColor()` to read them as a cached THREE.Color.
 *  - `global` holds multipliers that scale everything at once (1 = neutral).
 *  - The per-ability blocks (`flux`, `voidslash`, `glacial`, `drone`, …) hold absolute values.
 *
 * Every ability block is keyed by its id in `ELEMENTS`, and the shared systems
 * that need to know about "the ability the player is currently holding" — the
 * aim controller, the cooldown, the HUD — look it up as `settings[element]`.
 * The four fields they rely on being present are `range`, `minRange`, `speed`
 * and `cooldown`; everything else in a block is that ability's own business.
 * A **far cast** (`CastShape.ZONE`, declared in `ELEMENT_META`) adds a fifth:
 * `zoneRadius`, the footprint the circle indicator measures out.
 */

/**
 * The cast animations shipped alongside the rig, in `public/models/<id>.fbx`.
 *
 * Every ability block carries a `castAnim` naming one of these, so each spell
 * can throw the body differently; `CharacterController` loads all of them once
 * at boot and keeps only their clips, and the editor turns this array straight
 * into the per-ability dropdown.

   *
   *  - anything about the **cast** is in metres, because it is laid out against
   *    the aim indicator — `range`, `coneLength`, `coneRadius`, `ribbonSpan`;
   *  - anything about the **cone's surface** is in its own parameter space,
   *    where `u` runs 0 → 1 from the head to the mouth and `v` goes once
   *    around. `coneRings`, `coneRibs`, `coneSpiralTurns` and `coneHead` are
   *    counts and fractions in that space, not metres, which is what lets a
   *    two-metre funnel and a ten-metre one carry the same mesh.
   *
   * The palette is the load-bearing decision and it is worth stating plainly:
   * the **energy is crimson going rose** and the **matter is dark**. Blood
   * that glows is not blood — it is more light — so the one non-additive layer
   * in here is kept nearly black in shadow and earns its brightness from a wet
   * highlight instead. Swapping that round gives a red firework with pink

   * The drone's principle on the ground: a **toggle** that prints an armoured
   * one-wheeled sentry in on the floor in front of the caster and keeps it
   * there until it is recalled, locking every other slot while it is out.
   *
   * It is driven, not flown. The same stick, keys and open hand hand it the
   * same screen-relative demand, but a wheel cannot strafe: free, it turns to
   * face the stick and drives along its heading; locked onto a target it faces
   * the target and the stick is a tank's throttle. Closing the fist (or
   * holding fire) puts it to work exactly as it does the drone — nearest body
   * in the ring, turn on, lock, burst — with the burst alternating the two
   * guns on its nose.
   *
   * `range` is the ring; `speed` is here only because the shared contract
   * expects it. See `abilities/MonowheelAbility.js`.

   * the sheet does not draw: the glow flash is a *light source*, and once it is
   * lit it fires a beam of that light at whatever is standing in reach.
   *
   * The palette is the load-bearing decision. Everything here is one hue —
   * violet — pushed two ways: **cold** toward indigo and near-black for the
   * water, the mist and the crystal bases; **hot** toward magenta and white for
   * the corruption sealed inside the gems, the flare and the beam. The single
   * pure white on the sheet is the flash, and the beam carries it out.
   *
   * Two units are in play. Anything about the **footprint** — where the
   * crystals are planted, how wide the splash is, the rune's rails — is a
   * fraction of `zoneRadius`, so dragging the footprint re-seats the whole
